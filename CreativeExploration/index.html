      <h2>Silenced by the System <br> By Tyrone King</h2>
      <p>
        When I began thinking about how to represent the overwhelming feeling of helplessness many people experience when dealing with insurance companies, I asked myself,
        <em>“What does it feel like to be silenced?”</em> That question led me to explore the emotional weight behind not just the system itself, but the
        <strong>lack of voice</strong> people feel within it. It's not just frustration — it’s a kind of quiet despair, where the conversation feels one-sided, unheard, and stuck.

        Researching this topic was like opening Pandora’s box. The deeper I looked, the more layers I uncovered: red tape, denied claims, rising premiums, confusion,
        and a general lack of transparency. The complexity felt intentionally overwhelming — designed to disempower. As someone who isn’t a traditional visual artist,
        I turned to AI-generated images to help express these emotions. The image of a person with their mouth taped shut, surrounded by the names of powerful insurance companies,
        visually captures this feeling of being silenced and powerless in the face of bureaucracy. It’s a raw, symbolic representation of a system that many feel trapped within.
