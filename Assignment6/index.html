            <p>When discussing womanhood and gender within Latin American Arts, as well as how the topic is represented, few names come to mind Andrea Echeverri (“Echeverri”), Astrid Hadad (“Hadad”), Paz Errázuriz (“Errázuriz”), and Lourdes Grobet (“Grobet”) are names that are paramount when discussing womanhood and gender due to their unique artistry and perspectives.  They all showcase womanhood and challenge gender norms and standards in their own way. </p>
            <p>In this comparative essay, I will discuss how gender norms affect women in Latin America In this comparative essay, I will discuss how gender norms affect women in Latin America and how their voices impact the conversation, how gender in Latin America is perceived from different perspectives, and how their art impacts the interpretation of womanhood in Latin America. Gender norms in traditional Latin American roles can be described in two parts the role of a man, or how a man should act which can be seen in machismo.  The other is how a woman should act and be viewed which can be seen in marianismo.  These stereotypes and norms keep women in a box of what they are supposed to do.  This is described by Hadad in her song - La Tequilera where she says “As a good Mexican woman I must suffer the pain peacefully”.  This is a key part of marianismo on top of being how men who “practice” machismo view women.   Women are viewed as having to be the self-sacrificing mother, similar to the Virgin Mary; while men can do anything they want, even to the point of blaming women for their shortcomings.   This willingness to blame women can be heard in the traditional version of La Culpable “ The one at fault is you”.  Even when there is a call for the end of this unfair and repulsive treatment there is no change in behavior.  This can be heard in Echeverri's version of La Culpable where she says “I don’t want to be the guilty one”.</p>

            <p class="animated-scale">Gender norms have all affected these amazing artists, personally and professionally , as in the case of Hadad where she felt compelled to sing because she was inspired to do so.  Her inspiration for being an artist was inspired by a woman named Lucha Reyes (“Reyes”).  Reyes’ music was banned in Hadad’s household for the way she sang with strength in her voice.  
Errázuriz was affected professionally because her former husband did not support her photography career.  Errázuriz’s former husband did not support her career because he felt she was moving toward independence and not staying in her role as a self-sacrificing mother.  Additionally, established male photographers to whom she showed her work for recognition became enraged as seen in an interview “A housewife could never become a photographer”.   
Gender norms continued to be practiced, as in the story of Lourdes’s fascination with Lucha Libre.  She enjoyed the sport and wanted to see it in person.  Her interest in Lucha Libre did not matter to her dad because he refused to take her to any events; after all she was a girl.  Professionally, Lourdes was a photographer who wanted to photograph Lucha Libre.  She was treated as a nonperson because of her interest in photographing Lucha Libre.  As a woman this was unacceptable, however, she continued photographing Lucha Libre until she was accepted.  Even though the aforementioned women went through various trials they were still able to push through gender norms and show their creative minds and ideas to the world.  This leads me to how they all showed different aspects of gender within their work like Errázuriz Adam's Apple Project (“Apple Project”).
The Apple Project captured photos of Chilean prostitutes exuding their femininity, yet displaying masculine traits such as dominance.  This is in comparison to how Echeverri takes folk songs of Latin America and changes the lyrics to show femininity while expressing masculine traits.  In the song of La Cuchilla a Carrilera song Echeverri transforms the song into a punk masterpiece.  Echeverri takes songs and changes the male dominant voice to a feminine voice, but still shows aggressiveness an aspect that is usually associated with the machismo of a man as she says in this song “ If you don’t love me then I'll cut your face”.  Here both Errázuriz and Echeverri share their opinion on the topic but they have two different ways of expressing the message.  While Echeverri's message is a straightforward interpretation of her music; Errázuriz takes a whole outside approach of showing these prostitutes in positions of dominance while still being feminine.  Both women show different aspects of gender and how it can be fluid as in the case of Errázuriz, a lot of the prostitutes would have been seen as Trans or Non-Binary in today's context.  In the case of Echeverri, she can go from being violent in La Cuchilla to being more of an indifferent independent spirit who doesn't want to be tied down in La Culpable. 
In comparing Hadad and Grobet, how do they talk about the aspects of gender?  To answer this question, when I think about Hadad the performances that come to mind is when she does a rendition of what it is like when a man is courting a woman.  Additionally, in her comedic touch, she puts on a mustache to represent the man and flickers her tongue to represent the outward sexuality of machismo.  Coming from a woman this is unexpected from a traditional point of view, but shows in her performance she can take masculine traits and make them hilarious satire.  In addition to her masculine performances, she can perform the part of a woman who is being courted showing fluidity between the traits of both genders.
What about Grobet how does she put her whole spin on the topic?  Errázuriz shows Trans prostitutes embracing their femininity while still having some masculine traits. Grobet shows women embrace masculine traits of Lucha Libre with violence and aggression, but at the same time, she shows them being mothers and caretakers.  Although they are dressed up in Lucha masks they are continuing to take care of their children, working and juggling the challenges of everyday life.  They go between masculinity and femininity and this is shown in wrestling which is completely different from a song/performance.  While being in a different world entirely to Errázuriz?

            <p class="animated-fade">The Apple Project shows different aspects of gender and how it can be fluid.  
The art of these women has several impacts on what is a woman and what should be considered womanhood whether pointing out the double standard or hypocrisy that is followed into womanhood.  Errázuriz's impact on the Apple Project is what is considered masculine and feminine.  As one of her photo subjects Evelyn when dressing up for work shows what was considered very feminine traits like long hair and makeup.  On the other hand, when she is with her lover she is not dressed up to the fullest and wears a shirt with jeans.  Evelyn challenges the traditional view of what is feminity because Evelyn herself is still feminine, but does not fit into the box of Marianismo.  She is not chaste, she is a sex worker and identifies as feminine.  This impacts womanhood in many ways it shows that womanhood and femininity are not only constrained by the standard of Marianismo, but that womanhood does not always mean you start your life in the body of a woman.
In a similar but different way, Grobet impacts womanhood as she captures women in what is a male-dominated arena, Lucha Libre.  Not only do they take on the aggression and violence associated with it, but you also see them embrace their child and still be nurturing mothers.  So in one way yes they fit “marianismo” as they are loving mothers, but they still break that box by not being passive women.  They are not waiting for a man to do anything for them they are going out and supporting their families.  This is different from Errázuriz's as to the outside ignorant people it is a man doing a woman's job; according to Grobet, it's a woman performing a man role while still doing her role as a mother and caretaker of her children which shows fluidity from different starting points.  This helps impact the view of womanhood as you don't need to be passive and wait for a knight and shining armor.  These women helped support themselves by showing that women do not have to depend on a man.   
How does Hadad impact the interpretation of womanhood? Hadad tears down womanhood by first giving context in La Tequilera saying that a good woman has to suffer, but then she goes on later in another performance saying that “If you get a good hiding at least get a good fucking”.  This takes the glass context around “marianismo” and shatters it as not only is she not being “chaste” she is also displaying her sexuality as a man would.  This is similar to how Errázuriz's project does the same thing with Trans prostitutes but also different as she is on stage and performing this is also combined with her performance with her custom of huge breasts.  Again she is not afraid of showing her sexuality and not being the “innocent” woman of “marianismo”.  This helps to widen what can be interpreted as a woman.  The impact is that women are also sexual beings and have the right to express their sexuality Hadad shows that perfectly. 
To round this out we have Echeverri the way she impacts womanhood is in the way she is outspoken throughout her music.  Is this similar to Hadad? Yes, but she takes what is usually considered male voices and flips them to feminine voices.  Not only showing the woman's perspective, but a lot of the time giving the woman the main lead in the conversation.  Giving a voice to women that they are long overdue for she does not sit passively by and let men drag women.  She actively gives a response to men and takes the same attitude when responding.  This shows that women don’t have to be housewives, they can also be independent and a free spirit.  She also mentions that she doesn't want a child to ruin her in La Culpable which also shows that womanhood doesn't mean you need to bear children.  This is similar to the ideas that are shown in Errázuriz's work that womanhood is fluid you don't need to meet the standard and hypocrisy of marianismo.

            <p class="animated-slide">In conclusion, while all of these amazing women have dealt with marianismo, they have told their story.  From the Photography of Lucha Libre to Columbian Punk music, each woman has covered the topic and delivered their message regarding male, female, and gender fluidity.  In my opinion, it is very interesting how they have a Venn diagram-like relationship with each other sharing similarities, but also having stark differences and contrasts on what they all focus on. Thank you for reading my interpretation of these great artists.
