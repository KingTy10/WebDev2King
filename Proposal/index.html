	 <h1> Final Proposal</h1>

<p>The American healthcare system is complicated and often doesn’t get enough attention, even though it affects millions of people. One of the biggest issues is health insurance, which many people rely on to afford medical care. However, insurance companies often deny claims, making it hard for patients to get the treatments they need. While this has been a problem for years, a recent event—the assassination of a CEO—has brought new attention to how these companies operate. This tragedy has sparked a larger conversation about whether insurance companies prioritize profit over people’s health.</p>

    <p>Lately, public outrage over denied claims has grown louder. Many people have shared their experiences online, showing how difficult it can be to get insurance to cover necessary procedures. The discussion has also expanded to include rising insurance costs, expensive prescription drugs, and how healthcare access can depend on income level. More people are starting to question if the system is fair and whether changes need to be made.</p>

    <p>This moment is an important snapshot of how people feel about healthcare in the U.S. It’s unclear if this public outrage will lead to real change, but it has drawn attention to a system that many believe is broken. Health insurance companies have a history of making decisions based on profits rather than patient care. As more people become aware of how common insurance denials are, there may be more pressure for laws that make coverage fairer and more transparent.</p>

    <p>Looking at the numbers behind insurance denials can help us understand how serious the problem is. Every year, millions of claims are rejected, sometimes for unclear reasons or small mistakes. While some people can appeal and win, the process is often long and frustrating. By studying these trends, we can get a better idea of how insurance practices affect healthcare and what changes might be needed to make sure people get the medical care they need without unnecessary obstacles.</p>

    <h2>Research Artifacts</h2>

    <p>For my research, I think articles and videos would be useful artifacts. I don’t personally know anyone to interview, and setting up interviews would take extra effort, so I’ll likely rely on existing sources. Besides articles and videos, documentaries and newspapers could provide valuable insights into healthcare and insurance issues. These sources could help me understand the historical context, major events, and public opinion on the subject.</p>

    <p>Another interesting angle would be comparing healthcare systems in different countries. Looking at how insurance policies work elsewhere could highlight differences in cost, accessibility, and overall effectiveness. If possible, I might talk to people from other countries to get firsthand perspectives. This could help me see how the U.S. system compares and whether certain policies lead to better or worse outcomes.</p>

    <p>The scale of my research depends on how deep I want to go. If I focus only on American healthcare (or insurance in general), I can analyze key events and policies in more detail. If I include international comparisons, I’ll need to gather perspectives from multiple countries. Either way, I want to find reliable information that helps me better understand healthcare, insurance, and the challenges people face in accessing medical care, etc.</p>

    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>

    <p>I want to learn more about healthcare and insurance to understand how we got to this point. I’m interested in what led to certain policies, how insurance levels work, and what major changes have happened over time. I also want to explore major events that were made worse due to a lack of coverage, showing the real impact of the system on people’s lives.</p>

    <p>Beyond my own experiences and those of people around me, I want to get a broader view of public opinion on insurance. How do people outside my circle feel about it? Do attitudes differ based on location, income, or political views? Another key area I want to explore is how much money insurance companies in the U.S. make compared to those in other countries. This could help show whether the American system is unique in prioritizing profit.</p>

    <p>In addition to learning about healthcare, I also hope to improve my HTML skills. Expanding my knowledge in web development could help me present and organize the information I gather in a more effective way. Overall, I want to gain a deeper understanding of these topics and how they affect everyday life. As I believe this will be something that I can add to an important topic and conversation.</p>
