My Response to Design is dead
</h1> 
<p>
Something that agrees with the author is the sense of an uncertain future when it comes to A.I. the author states" The lingering concern that A.I. may replace our jobs or render traditional design
unnecessary is a harsh reality to consider, especially if you are just entering this field". This idea is something that has crossed my mind more than twice I am not a traditional designer as I do more backend things. However, I found myself even asking my professors how they felt when it came to A.I. replacing our jobs. One of them responds in a sense that for the most part, A.I. is not to the level of Human creativity cause they are copying what we give it as well it is simply not good enough to understand complex problems in the same way humans are able.
Even though this was more from a backend of programming perspective I think this also does currently apply to A.I. when it comes to front-end design as an A.I. doesn't have the same ability to evoke a creative process that a human has. Therefore it's not able to put expression within an art piece or a design.

Despite my opinion, something I found interesting is "A.I. is excellent at performing predictive analytics that can analyze large amounts of data to predict user behavior and preferences." 
This was something that stuck out to me a interesting because when I thought about it I picked up on this when I would watch a video on something like Instagram the product would usually pop up on YouTube or TikTok marketplace. I think this is definitely true but more and more nowadays people are looking for different way to protect there data as data mining as a term has made it into main stream media. 
Which I believe should lower A.I. accuracy in the future as well at least in my opinion I feel like A.I. currently is overhyped in terms of what it can do. Does it make our job more efficient yes but will it take over our job I don't think so unless you are not good in your field thing that requires like mentioned before creativity but not creativity but a certain type as well the speed you can come up with a good idea that work for both you, your client, and potential costumers will be hard to replace with a machine that goes off of certain data which may or may not be filtered incorrectly. 
A interesting thing I feel this situation has in common with is the Games industrey in the sense that A.I. was going to replace alot of job but when looking at what A.I. can do it seen more as a tool rather than a force that should be feared at least that my opinion.

<p> 
In conclusion going back to the beginning of the article this statement"In a culture where God has the potential to be substituted by science, whoâ€™s to say that?AI can not just replace designers, but design itself?" I think has some credence to it but when I think about what the author has said throughout the article I tend to overall we are in a current culture that has yet to replace God fully with science as there are still things that cannot be explained by science the same way people will not replace the designer as A.I. there are too many nuances in design that I don't think A.I. able to do they still haven't been able to fix A.I. and the finger issues. 
Another thing is that A.I. I feel like is a tool like anything else same way that Ditgal animator for shows like Spongebob still draw out the cells for each episode and use photoshops to fix them is the same line of reasoning a designer would use A.I. to streamline the work flow they have to do.
