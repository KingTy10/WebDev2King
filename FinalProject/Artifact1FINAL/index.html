        <div class="Intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For my first research artifact, I wanted to understand the current sentiment people have toward insurance companies. To achieve this goal, I educated myself by reading a few articles, which are linked below. One of the first articles I found was titled <strong>“Americans Are Angry About Their Health Insurance—With Good Reason.”</strong></p>
        </div>
        
	<div class="section-wrapper">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Findings from the Article</h2>
            <p>The article opens with a shocking event: the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City. While such violent acts usually provoke public shock, many Americans actually reacted with celebration. This response stemmed from their frustration with health insurance companies like UnitedHealthcare. </p>
            <p>Americans are angry due to practices that prioritize profits over patient care, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High premiums</li>
                <li>Prior authorization requirements</li>
                <li>Exclusions from networks</li>
                <li>Denied claims</li>
            </ul>
        
   
            <h2>Impact on Healthcare Providers</h2>
            <p>A survey conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the American Hospital Association (AHA) found:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>80% of physicians said insurance policies affect how they practice medicine.</li>
                <li>84% of physicians reported increased administrative burdens.</li>
                <li>84% of nurses said insurance delays care.</li>
                <li>74% of nurses reported reduced quality of care due to insurance policies.</li>
                <li>62% of patients delayed care for insurance-related reasons.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

			<h3>Web Dev Notes </h3>
			 <p> So this page is when i tried doing more stuff as you see the box should be to the right of the text unless i changed it last min to make my notes some dumb
				whether it is just a box or a oval is still in the air at this point i am leaning toward the box just cause it easier to do any im got crazier shapes for later dev notes ideas 
			 but this is was probably hard just because it my first time doing stuff with section wrappers and flex display in a while i also looked up some help for this just understanding flex display etc,etc
			 </p>

        </div>
        <div class="section2">
            <h2>Survey Methodology</h2>
            <p>The survey was conducted between 2022 and 2023 and included over 2,500 participants: 1,502 adult patients, approximately 500 nurses, and around 500 physicians. The margin of error was ±3-4%.</p>
            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>The fact that 84% of nurses reported that insurance delays care is concerning. Delays in care, whether serious or minor, can still lead to negative outcomes. Additionally, 80% of physicians stated that insurance affects how they practice medicine, and 84% believe insurance requirements make it harder to run a solo practice.</p>
            <p>Moving forward, I plan to gather more personal stories about how insurance companies affect people's lives. While statistics are eye-opening, personal experiences create a stronger emotional connection.</p>
