            <h3>The Growing Concern of Insurance Interference in Medicine</h3>
            <p>The role of insurance companies in influencing medical decisions has been a longstanding concern for both physicians and patients. Recent data highlights just how significant this issue is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Over 80% of physicians</strong> report that insurance policies directly impact how they practice medicine.</li>
                <li><strong>84% of physicians</strong> state that these policies lead to <strong>delays in patient care.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>One particularly troubling case that illustrates this issue involves <strong>Dr. Elisabeth Potter</strong>, a plastic surgeon based in Texas, who recently went viral after sharing her shocking encounter with <strong>UnitedHealthcare (UHC).</strong></p>

            <h3>A Shocking Interruption in the Operating Room</h3>
            <p>Dr. Potter was in the middle of performing <strong>breast cancer surgery</strong> when she received an <strong>“urgent call.”</strong> On the other end of the line was a <strong>UHC representative,</strong> questioning whether it was <strong>“absolutely necessary”</strong> for her patient to stay overnight post-surgery.</p>
            <p>Given that the surgery was <strong>medically necessary for a cancer patient</strong>—not a cosmetic or elective procedure—Dr. Potter was <strong>appalled</strong> by the inquiry.</p>
            <p>Frustrated by what she perceived as a <strong>cost-cutting move at the expense of patient care</strong>, Dr. Potter took to <strong>TikTok</strong> to share the experience. The video quickly went <strong>viral</strong>, with overwhelming public support condemning <strong>UHC’s</strong> actions.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>UnitedHealthcare Responds with Legal Threats</h3>
            <p>As the controversy gained momentum, <strong>UnitedHealthcare escalated the situation</strong> by taking <strong>legal action</strong> against Dr. Potter. In a follow-up post, she revealed that UHC had:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hired a powerful defamation law firm</strong> to issue her a <strong>cease-and-desist letter.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Accused her of spreading false information,</strong> claiming that UHC <strong>never instructed her to step out of surgery.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Stated that her own office had contacted UHC</strong> regarding the overnight stay (which was ultimately <strong>denied</strong>).</li>
                <li><strong>Alleged that her video contributed to “dangerous misinformation”</strong> because of comments referencing <strong>Luigi Mangione</strong>, the alleged assassin of <strong>UHC’s former CEO, Brian Thompson.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Dr. Potter Refuses to Back Down</h3>
            <p>Despite facing legal threats from a major insurance company, <strong>Dr. Potter refused to retract her statements.</strong> She described <strong>UHC’s response as gaslighting and manipulation</strong> and vowed to continue speaking out.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
            <p>UnitedHealthcare is currently under <strong>intense public scrutiny</strong>, not just for this situation but also for the <strong>ongoing legal case surrounding their deceased former CEO.</strong></p>
            <p>As I continue my research, my focus will shift toward:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The patient perspective</strong> – How do insurance policies impact those directly receiving care?</li>
                <li><strong>The Luigi Mangione connection</strong> – How does this controversy tie into <strong>UHC’s handling of their CEO’s assassination?</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Much of what happens behind the scenes may <strong>never be fully revealed</strong>, but one thing is certain: <strong>this case is far from over.</strong></p>
